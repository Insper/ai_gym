# AIGYM

This is a package with basic AI algorithms. This package is used in some subjects at Insper. 

## How to setup the environment

To avoid any configuration problems, we recommend creating a virtual environment with python:

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To quit the virtual environment, type `deactivate`. If you already have the virtual environment configured then type `source venv/bin/activate`.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/home/fbarth/workspaces/ai_gym/:.
```
